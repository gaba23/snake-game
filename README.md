<h1 align=center>Hi, Welcome to my new project!</h1>

<h2>How the idea came?</h2>
My name is Gaba, me and my friend Isaluh made a project based on the clasic game of the snake game, we'd the idea of try to do a game using only python, and the idea of trying the snake game sounded fun and challenging.

<h2>Language and Library used</h2>

<p>On this project we used only python as language and pygame, a python library.</p>

<h2>How to play:</h2>

<p>Download the .rar file, extract the main file annd execute the .exe application named "main", after that, just have fun, try to not hit yourself or the wall.</p>

<h2>Como jogar:</h2>

<p>Baixe o arquivo .rar, extraia a pasta main e abra o arquivo executável "main.exe", após isso basta se divertir, tente não acertar a si mesmo ou bater nas paredes.</p>

By Gaba and Isaluh.
